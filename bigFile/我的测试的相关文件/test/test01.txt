雅思口语part1参考示例:
Iaaaaaaaaaaaa use an electronic English dictionary on a daily basis,since i am used to browsing an English news app during commuting and can spot some new words or phrases so often.
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaI like them both. I've got a wide range of paper dictionaries for English learning,and it was really a help when i was at university.But now i prefer the electronic one since it can easily go with me.
bbbbbbbbbbbbbbit won't be a overstatement to call me a English dictionary buff. I have Oxford English dictionary,Cambridge English dictionary for sure. and i also have a oral English dictionary, a dictionary for English slang, a dictionary for euphemism, a dictionary for collocation, a dictionary for grammar.Oh the list can go on and on. But in a nut shell, they are all for English learning.
dddddddddddddddI believe no matter the dictionary is paper or digital,it is to?satisfy user's need.So in the future, paper dictionary will provide more than just a book. Maybe more dictionaries will have their own websites and online?versions and develop into a community covering more than just language learning.
