If students do not have good command of relevant knowledge,repeating teaching the same knowledge is needed. Moreover, vast subject knowledge is also required or you cannot share knowledge with your students. 8.Do you like strict teachers?
你喜欢严格的老师么?
Yeah I do. I have no problem with them at all, as long as they’re fair! Because I think, on the whole, they tend to set high standards, and so consequently, that makes us work harder and learn more. And the other good thing about strict teachers is that they keep students in line, which means that the class won’t be interrupted by naughty students who just want to joke around and be a nuisance.
9.What’s the difference between young and old teachers?
年轻的老师与年长的老师有什么区别?
There’s probably not all that much difference actually, but I guess the main one would be the level of experience. You know, I think it’s fair to say that old teachers tend to have more experience than young ones, and so they’ll be more skilled at adapting to any kind of situation that might arise in class, whereas young teachers might struggle. So that’s one difference, and I suppose another might be the use of technology, cos probably a lot of old teachers might stick to the traditional teaching methods they’re familiar with, whereas young teachers, I think, are more likely to bring technology into their teaching, such as using iPads and laptops in class. So yeah, I’d say these are probably the main differences.

Punctuality

I think I am，at least I always try to be on time. But you know, living in a city where traffic jam is an unavoidable part of the daily life makes it difficult to be a punctual person. But I wouldn’t want to use it as an excuse so I tend to set out earlier when I go to an appointment just in case.

I like wearing watches and I used to wear them. However, with changing times, I have stopped wearing one and I watch time by mobile phone.

I think it is quite of a relative question. So, it mostly depends on the situation.

Also, if you know someone is waiting for you, one must try to be on time.
